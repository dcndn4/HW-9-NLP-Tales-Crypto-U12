# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom (especially the Quantitative Finance community) essential as ever. Regarding Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, the Geron text continued to be helpful.
