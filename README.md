# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom (especially the Quantitative Finance community) essential as ever. Regarding Time Series and Machine Learning overall I utilized information from the geeksforgeeks.org (again) website, as well as Jason Brownlee's '11 Classical Time Series Forecasting Methods in Python (Cheat Sheet)' page, 'Time Series Analysis in Python - A Comprehensive Guide with Examples' from the Machine_Learning_+ website, and the Dataquest website's tutorial 'Time Series Analysis with Pandas'; as well as the tech website collective in general. The Pandas books section on Time Series were helpful.
